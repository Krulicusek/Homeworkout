# Homeworkout - __cross-platform workout app__
Homeworkout is a multi-platform application designed to facilitate physical activity and contact with people involved in the patient's physical development.

The Homeworkout application allows you to create personalized training plans for patients. Patients have the opportunity to learn the correct way to perform exercises and, thanks to the built-in functions, they can exercise together with the application. The physiotherapist has access to all his patients and has information about their progress.
